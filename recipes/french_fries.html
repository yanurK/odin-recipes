        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt/li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>

        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning brown. </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon. </li>
            <li>Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time. </li>
            <li>Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate. </li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
        </ol>
